# Security Policy

We take all security issues seriously and we welcome all feedback from all 
researchers and users in order to improve the security of the webserver.

## Reporting security issues

Please do not report any security issues through Github issues. Instead, contact the developer 
privately. This also is not purposed for any non-security bugs.

When reporting, provide the type of issue you've found and a screenshot showing the issue. If
possible, provide how the issue has occurred/how could it be recreated.
